# ToDoList
 ToDoList app written by using html, css and javascript. 

Application created basis on the video course: https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-jedyny-kurs-ktorego-potrzebujesz/

HTML and CSS code was downloaded from course.

JavaScript code was written only by me, with little assistance of video course.

Implemented functionalities:

- adding new tasks

- task editing

- task deleting

  

Project will be updated as my skills grow.

I'm planning to add some functionalities based on backend, I'm currently in the process of learning.
